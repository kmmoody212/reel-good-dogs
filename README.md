# Reel Good Dogs 🌭🏖️

This is a website created for the future restaurant "Reel Good Dogs". At the moment, the website features an about page, a menu, and other basic information about the business. 

This site was also created as a solution to an assignment in the Full Stack JavaScript Course by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). 

The assignment criteria calls for a restaurant page that uses JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website (other than the header/navbar).
